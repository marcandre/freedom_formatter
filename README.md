# ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ Freedom Formatter ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸

A fork of Elixir's code formatter, with added freedom.
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/gamache/freedom_formatter.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/gamache/freedom_formatter) [![Hex.pm Version](http://img.shields.io/hexpm/v/freedom_formatter.svg?style=flat)](https://hex.pm/packages/freedom_formatter)

Freedom Formatter respects `.formatter.exs` and supports all
features of the standard code formatter, as well as additional
features unlikely to arrive soon in core Elixir.

## Usage

Install:

```elixir
{:freedom_formatter, "~> 1.0", only: :dev}
```

Run:

```bash
mix fformat
```

## Why

Elixir's code formatter does not intend to support trailing commas,
or indeed any additional settings, until at least January 2019.
See Elixir issues [#7689](https://github.com/elixir-lang/elixir/pull/7689)
and [#6646](https://github.com/elixir-lang/elixir/issues/6646) for more
information.

Thanks to software freedom, we can use tomorrow's formatter today.

## Project Goals

* To provide a compatible alternative to the Elixir formatter,
  available separately from the core Elixir distribution
* To allow developers and teams to benefit from standardized code
  formatting while retaining a style they find more productive
* To be a testbed for new formatting features and options,
  maintaining the easiest possible path to possible inclusion in
  core Elixir.

## Added features

Freedom Formatter supports all Elixir's standard code formatting
options, as well as:

* `:trailing_comma` - if set `true`, multi-line list, map, and
  struct literals will include a trailing comma after the last item
  or pair in the data structure. Does not affect argument lists,
  tuples, or lists/maps/structs rendered on a single line.

## Authorship and License

Freedom Formatter is released under the same license as Elixir itself,
the Apache License Version 2.0, included here as the file `LICENSE`.

Freedom Formatter is based upon the Elixir code formatter, whose
implementation and tests are included in this project.
The core Elixir formatter was written by JosÃ© Valim, with
contributions from Andrea Leopardi and others.

Customizations to the formatter are written by Pete Gamache.
