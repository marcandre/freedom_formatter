A fork of Elixir's code formatter, with added freedom.
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/gamache/freedom_formatter.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/gamache/freedom_formatter) [![Hex.pm Version](http://img.shields.io/hexpm/v/freedom_formatter.svg?style=flat)](https://hex.pm/packages/freedom_formatter)

Freedom Formatter is a formatter plugin for Elixir files (`.ex` and `.exs`).
It supports all features of the standard code formatter (forked from Elixir 1.14.0),
as well as additional features.

## Added Features

## Usage

Install by adding the package to your `mix.exs`

```elixir
{:freedom_formatter, ">= 2.0.0", only: :dev}
```

Specify this package as a plugin for the formatter in `.formatter.exs`:

```elixir
# .formatter.exs
[
  inputs: [
    # ...
  ],
  plugins: [
    # ...
    # Add this:
    FreedomFormatter,
  ],

  # Additional options are now supported:
  trailing_comma: true,
]
```

An elixir bug ([fixed but not released yet](https://github.com/elixir-lang/elixir/issues/11915)) currently requires the app `FreedomFormatter` to be compiled first before attempting to format.

```
# Do this:
mix deps.get
mix compile
# Before you do that:
mix format
```

## Why

Elixir's code formatter does not intend to support trailing commas,
or indeed any additional settings.
See Elixir issues [#7689](https://github.com/elixir-lang/elixir/pull/7689)
and [#6646](https://github.com/elixir-lang/elixir/issues/6646) for more
information.

## Project Goals

- To provide a compatible alternative to the Elixir formatter,
  available separately from the core Elixir distribution
- To allow developers and teams to benefit from standardized code
  formatting while retaining a style they find more productive
- To be a testbed for new formatting features and options,
  maintaining the easiest possible path to possible inclusion in
  core Elixir.

## Authorship and License

Freedom Formatter is released under the same license as Elixir itself,
the Apache License Version 2.0, included here as the file `LICENSE`.

Freedom Formatter is based upon the Elixir code formatter, whose
implementation and tests are included in this project.
The core Elixir formatter was written by Jos√© Valim, with
contributions from Andrea Leopardi and others.

Authored by Pete Gamache.
Maintance by Marc-Andr√© Lafortune.

### Notes

- This project uses semantic versioning.
- This project gets a new branch for each new minor version of elixir (unless no change was made to the formatter).
- Each new branch has its history completely rewritten.

### Changelog

v2.1.0: Adds `local_pipe_with_parens` option. Requires Elixir 1.14.0+

v2.0.0: Now a formatter plugin; as such it requires Elixir 1.13.2+
